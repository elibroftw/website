# Rocket.rs Tutorial

My goal is to be able to covert some of my website's flask backend into a rocket.rs backend without changing my templates by too much.
Doing so will make me a more proficient Rust programmer and I'll also be able to churn out a couple videos like

- Tauri Updater Rocket.rs | Intro to Rocket.rs
- Rocket.rs templates
- Rocket.rs CSRF Protection

A helpful command to debug faster

```sh
cargo 2>cargo.log
```
